DynamicCard
===========

Installation:
------------

### Directly include source into your projects

- Simply copy the source/resource files from the library folder into your project.

### Use binary approach

- Follow these steps to include aar binary in your project:

    1: Copy com.github.gfranks.dynamiccard-1.0.aar into your projects libs/ directory.

    2: Include the following either in your top level build.gradle file or your module specific one:
    ```
      repositories {
         flatDir {
             dirs 'libs'
         }
     }
    ```
    3: Under your dependencies for your main module's build.gradle file, you can reference that aar file like so: 
    ```compile 'com.github.gfranks.dynamiccard:com.github.gfranks.dynamiccard-1.0@aar'```
